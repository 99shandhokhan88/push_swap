# push_swap

"push_swap" is a computer science project that challenges students to create an algorithm in the C programming language. The objective is to sort a randomly ordered list of numbers in two stacks (Stack A and Stack B) using a limited set of predefined actions, such as swapping elements, rotating the stacks, and pushing elements between the stacks. The main goal of the project is to sort the numbers in Stack A with the fewest possible actions. Students must devise efficient sorting strategies to accomplish this within the project's action limit.
